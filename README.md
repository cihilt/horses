Project Goal
-------------


My site tries to  predicts the position of a horse to real horse races in Australia.
The prediction is done by combining current and past data and applying algorithms onto this data.
Currently there is two algorithms.

The first one is located at:
/beta/updatehptime.php

The current Project Goal is Parallel PHP


How to do this
-------------

This task is currently being worked on.


How The site works
-------------
In order to do race predicions, we need to have data.
This data is historical data and current data.
This data collectively is used to give a Ranking and a Rating. 

This injected data needs to be organized, so we organise this data in the following order.

Meetings -> Race Name(Number) -> Race ID -> Horses.


First there is meetings, like location (randwick, flemington), 
these meetings are attached to a date: i.e (29th,30th, 1st, 2nd and so on.


Under the meeting date, is the race name, or race number.
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

In the db these are set at race id.
i.e 672 would be found as http://209.182.232.82/beta/race.php?race=672


For each raceid, we gather information about the horses past and present.
This information is contained in the db tables
--> tbl_hist_results (past races)
--> tbl_horses & tbl_temp_hraces (current race)

The order could be represented like this:

Meeting id (91)
 |
 -> Race id (667-675)
    |
     -> Race Id selected(672)(tbl_horses & tbl_temp_hraces)
        |
        -> Horse Id (692)->Winx
            |
             -> Distances
                (1000)
                (1100)
		(1200)
		(1300)
		(1400)
		(1500)
              **(1600)** (race id 672 is run at this distance)
		(1700)                  |
		(1800)                  --> tbl_hist_results (past races)
                (.../) and so on
                  |
                  -> tbl_hist_results (past races)


 
How does the Algorithm Work
-------------
We get the following data, such as  past Historical Data 
-> tbl_hist_results (past races) and race data (tbl_horses & tbl_temp_hraces)

But while retrieving this data, we add a formula to the field called handicap.
Handicap = Minimum Time + (extra functions)

These extra functions are (distance rounding)
                          (Length behind winner)

Distance Rounding
-----------------
Distance Rounding is done, when the horses (past races) are at unusual distance, such as 1205, 1330.
We round this off to the closest 1000 and apply either a time increase penalty, or time reduction)


Length behind Winner
-------------------
Its rare to be able to find individual horse time, so we use the time from the winner.
If the horse didn't win, we use length from the winner and apply a penalty.

(Using these two functions is how we get handicap value)


How is Average Rank Algorithm calculated?
-------------
At this stage, AverageRank = fastest handicap time with a point allocation system.
More information about how this works can be found on distance.php with checking comments //gavri.

In summary, we retreive the historical data and group them into distances.
For instance: Horse can have previously raced at:
 1200,1300,1400,1600,1700

We combine horses that have raced at the same distance.
So these horses should all have similar times.

A good example of this is Raceid 672i, below I will describe this in the code.

############### Start Code BreakDown

We loop through a particular race id, where the odds are not 0.
Then we loop through each distance.

Starting from maybe 800, then 900, then 1000, then 1100, 1200.
We then count the number of unique entries in each of these historical distance.

if($countofhorses > 0) {
                                                                        $per = ($cnt / $countofhorses) * 100;

If this condition is passed we then loop through the distances (DISTINCT) then order in ascending.

 while ($rowrc = $raceres->fetch_object()) {
                                $countofhorses = get_rows("`tbl_temp_hraces` WHERE `race_id`='$rowrc->race_id' AND `horse_fxodds`!='0'");
                                echo 'All below results are for Race ID: ' . $rowrc->race_id . '<br /><br />';
                                $get_distances = $mysqli->query("SELECT DISTINCT CAST(race_distance AS UNSIGNED) AS racedist FROM tbl_hist_results WHERE `race_id`='$rowrc->race_id' AND `race_distance`='$distance' ORDER by racedist ASC");

After looping through the required distances, we put these into an array called $numbersarray

while($dists = $get_distances->fetch_object()) {
                    // echo '<b>$dists->racedist</b>: '.$dists->racedist.'<br>';
                                        $handitotal = get_handisum($rowrc->race_id, $dists->racedist);
                                        //echo $dists->racedist . ' ( ' . $handitotal . ' )<br />';
                                        $numbersarray = get_array_of_handicap($rowrc->race_id, $dists->racedist);
                                        $cnt = count($numbersarray);

Say for a particular race id  = 672 and race distance of 1200, you would end up with the following array.
Noticed the minimum, this is the one we select

                    // handicap of Happy Clapper 1.18, 1.24,1.22. minimum is 1.18
                    // handicap of Patrick Erin 1.3, 1.3, 1.34, 1.27, 1.26, 1.25, 1.24. minimum is 1.24
                    // handicap of  Winx 1.24. minimum is 1.24
                    // handicap of Unforgotten 1.24, 1.26. minimum is 1.24


Then we use this minimum time and allocate a points system

function generate_rank($value, $array, $order = 0) {
// sort  
    //$value = 1.18, $array = [1.18,1.24,1.24,1.24], $order = 0
    //$order = 0 so go to rsort($array)
    if ($order)
        sort($array);
    else
        rsort($array);
    //rsort function is function that sorts an indexed array in descending order
    // so $array = [1.24,1.24,1.24,1.18]
// add item for counting from 1 but 0
    array_unshift($array, $value + 1);
    //array_unshift is function that adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array
    // so $array = [2.18, 1.24, 1.24, 1.24, 1.18]
// select all indexes vith the value
    $keys = array_keys($array, $value);
    //array_keys(a, b) Returns all the keys of an array that value is $value
    // $value = 1.18 so $keys = [4]
    if (count($keys) == 0)
        return NULL;
// calculate the rank

    // $res = array_sum($keys) / count($keys);

    $me = count($keys) ;
    //array_sum returns the sum of the values in an array
    //so $res = 4 / 1
    //result this function return 2
    // go to previous function Line: 463
    // return $res / 2;
    return $me;




About race.php
-------------

Race combines the current race data such as:
No, Weight, Form, Odds

Race also combines a  past history of the horse such as:
Distance, sectional,Race Pos, Rating, Rank

So If you entered:
http://209.182.232.82/beta/race.php?race=672
You will see the combination of two tables gathered to display details.


The following fields mean the following:
